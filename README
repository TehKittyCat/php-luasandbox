This is a PHP extension. To compile it:

 $ phpize
 $ ./configure
 $ make

It requires a few dependencies:

 luajit - LUA just in time compiler. http://www.luajit.org/
 ICU - set of libraries providing Unicode and Globalization support

== Mac OS X ==

Using brew:
 brew install luajit
 brew install icu4c
 # Formula being keg-only, you need to link it manually
 brew link icu4c

That will makes pkg-config files available. Check them using:
 ls -l `brew --prefix/lib/pkgconfig/icu*pc`
